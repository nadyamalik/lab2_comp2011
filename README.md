# Wolf, Sheep, Cabbage, and Boat Game
The skeleton was made by the TA, but the logic is my code.

## What is this game?
You need to move the wolf, sheep, and cabbage to the other side (from left to right).

      **Winning criteria**    : successfully move wolf, sheep, and cabbage to the right side

      **Losing criteria**     : wolf together with sheep OR sheep together with cabbage ==> you lose
